# Style Boards HTML Templates

HTML Framework for developing Style Boards in browser. (no Photoshop!) This is by no means "it" or the only way to do it. This just a starting point I use. 

## Depandancies
None. Sure I dig the Responsive Compass powered sites with great server side slickity code. This isn't meant for production code

## Get Started
You know your HTML and CSS and there isn't that much. Jump in!
